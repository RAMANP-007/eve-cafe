          <p className="lead text-muted">
            The name "EveCafe" was chosen to evoke a sense of warmth, comfort, and the inviting atmosphere of a cozy evening gathering. It's a place where people can unwind, connect, and enjoy quality food and beverages in a relaxed setting. The name also subtly hints at the cafe's commitment to offering a diverse menu that caters to different tastes and preferences, much like the variety of experiences one might have throughout an evening.

          <h4 className="mt-5">Inspiration Behind the Caf√©</h4>
          <p className="lead text-muted">
            EveCafe was born out of a passion for creating a community hub that celebrates the rich culinary traditions of Bengaluru while embracing modern, sustainable practices. Inspired by the city's vibrant culture and the growing appreciation for locally sourced ingredients, we envisioned a space where people could savor delicious food and drinks while feeling good about their choices. Our goal is to offer a unique dining experience that reflects the spirit of Bengaluru, from its bustling streets to its tranquil gardens.
